An interface is (without much surprise) a communication interface with the outside world.

Its goal is to read_data and process_t packets. A Packet is :
- a command identifier, that allows the interface to schedule a particular command.
- data, for the command referenced by the command identifier


It has two distinct functions :
    - Reading and parsing packets from a data link, that can be configured, and schedule the execution of commands.
    - Parsing data.


The two functions are distinct, because the data parsingcan be a long, resources consuming,
    and (sometimes) unnecessary process_t. It is the scheduled function, that will trigger if necessary, the data
    parsing.


The routine of an interface will be like the following :

0 - Called by the TaskScheduler, when a task can be scheduled.
1 - Read a packet from its data link, if available.
2 - Copy the data of the packet in its own buffer.
3 - When the packet has been received entirely, parse only the command part.
4 - Save data in its data container.
5 - Schedule the execution of the function referenced by the command identifier, and go back to step 1.

As we mentioned behind, the parsing of data is :
- specific to the interface, some interfaces may parse all data in one, and others may parse them one by one.
- always triggered by the scheduled function, when it is necessary.
