/*
 * TODO EVENT REMOVAL PATCH :
 *
 *  There are three things to add to the model :
 *      - Modify the sequences_initialised variable in the event structure, to share its sequences_initialised : IDLE, PENDING, CLOSED
 *
 *      - The task recuperation function must check that the event is deletable after caching the task;
 *          if it is deletable, it will delete all its tasks, except the last one that is currently in execution;
 *
 *      - A function that will search by name for an event to delete, and then check for its sequences_initialised.
 *          If it is idle, delete it, and if it is pending, mark it as deletable;
 *
