 FORMULAS FOR JERK REGULATION :

    Definition 1 : global speed V. The global speed is the speed of the machine on a particular speed group.
        This speed has a physical meaning (the speed of a carriage in space for example), has its unit (unit)
        and is regulated during the movement.

    Definition 1 : global distance D. The global distance during a movement is the distance that the machine on
        a particular group of axis, this group axis being a speed group.
        This distance has a physical meaning (the distance a carriage traveled in space for example), has its unit (unit)
        and is controlled during the movement.

     Definition 2 : jerk limit Ji. A steppers mustn't have its speed changing more than its jerk limit in a brief time
        period.

        CoefficientArray (E1) : |vi+ - vi-| < Ji;

    Notations :
        - V- (unit/s)   : global speed before the jerk movement;
        - V+ (unit/s)   : global speed after the jerk movement;
        - D- (unit)     : global distance of the sub movement before the jerk point;
        - D+ (unit)     : global distance of the sub movement after the jerk point;
        - vi- (steps_per_unit/s) : steppers motor i speed before the movement (steps_per_unit/s);
        - vi+ (steps_per_unit/s) : steppers motor i speed after the movement (steps_per_unit/s);
        - si- (steps_per_unit)   : steppers motor i distance for the sub movement before the jerk point;
        - si+ (steps_per_unit)   : steppers motor i distance for the sub movement after the jerk point;
        - Ji (steps_per_unit/s)  : jerk limit on steppers i;
        - t- (s)        : the duration of the sub movement before the jerk point;
        - t+ (s)        : the duration of the sub movement after the jerk point;

    Prerequisites :
        V(unit/s) = D(unit/s) / t(s) <=> t(s) = D(unit) / V(unit/s);
        vi(steps_per_unit/s) = si(steps_per_unit) / t(s);


    Proposition 1 : The global speed before a jerk point and after a jerk point is the same.

        Explanation : The speed variation is regulated by the machine, and can only occur continuously (or, as the
            movement is discrete, during a movement). A jerk point is (as its name says), a point, and the global speed
            must, as a consequence, remain the same before and after.
            This means that only steppers speeds will vary during the jerk.

        ie :  V+ = V- = V;

        Consequence :
            - t+ = D+ / V
            - t- = D- / V

    Definition 3 : targetVector speed. The targetVector speed Vt, for a jerk point, is the maximum speed that allow all steppers to
        stay beyond their jerk limit.


    Determination of Vt :

        For all steppers, we must have

        (E1)    |vi+ - vi-| < Ji
            =>  |si+ / t+ - si- / t-| < Ji
            =>  |si+ / D+ - si- / D-| * Vt < Ji
            =>  Vt < Ji / |si+ / D+ - si- / D-|


    Result :

        Vt is the greater speed that verifies for all steppers the following condition :

            Vt < Ji / |si+ / D+ - si- / D-|
