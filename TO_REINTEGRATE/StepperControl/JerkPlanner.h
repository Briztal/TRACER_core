/*
 * The JerkPlanner class. This class handles the jerk planning, and for this, has two public functions :
 *
 *  - save_final_jerk_offsets : this function is called for every movement planned. Its goal is to prepare the jerk
 *      computation for this movement's ending point. The eventual computation will eventually occur if another
 *      movement is planned right after this one, if the movement procedure is not ended.
 *
 *  - compute_jerk : this function called when a movement is being planned, and almost another one has already been
 *      planned. It handles the actual jerk computation for the beginning point of this movement, which explains why
 *      it is not called for the first movement planned, whose first point begins the movement procedure (no jerk).
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------- IMPORTANT -----------------------------------------
 *
 *      The save_final_jerk_offsets function  couldn't be called at the same time than the jerk computation,
 *          as both function use pre-process_t trajectory functions, during the jerk ratios computation, and there
 *          functions are static. Those use static data, that is not available during the planning of a movement.
 *
 *          If both movements were lines, and we tried to execute this function at the same time than compute_jerk,
 *          we would be calling the same function (the EXACT same function) for both movements.
