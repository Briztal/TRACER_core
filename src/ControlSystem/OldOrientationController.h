 * OldOrientationController : this class is a feedback controller, used to control the orientation of a system.
 *
 *  Its target is expressed in the (incomplete) spherical coordinate system, (theta, phi), where :
 *      - theta represents the inclination orientation angle [0;2Pi]
 *      - phi represents the inclination intensity [0;PI];
 *

 * Inputs :
 *
 *      target position  (theta, phi)
 *
 *      current position (theta, phi)
 *
 *
 *  output : rotation vector, in the (r, t) plan.
 *
 *      this vector is the correction vector, that will lead the system to its target;
 *
 *      It is obtained from two PIDs, one for r, one for t.
 *
 *
 *
 * Process :
 *
 *      Notations :
 *          - target_theta = Tt, target_phi = Pt;
 *          - current_theta = T, current phi = P;
 *
 *      A trivial error vector in the (r, t) plan, (Er, Et) would verify the following formula :
 *
 *          Er = cos(Tt) * Pt - cos(T) * P;
 *          Et = sin(Tt) * Pt - sin(T) * P;
 *
 *      However, according to this formula, when both targets and positions are at phi = pi, the error is not null,
 *          and depends on theta. It needs to be developed a little bit.
 *
 *      However, this formula does its job well when almost one phi coordinate is below pi/2;
 *
 *      As a consequence, the error vector verifies the formula below :
 *
 *
 *      If one phi (target or current) is <= pi/2 (case 0) :
 *
 *          Er = cos(Tt) * Pt - cos(T) * P;
 *          Et = sin(Tt) * Pt - sin(T) * P;
 *
 *      If both phi.s are > pi/2 (case 1) :
 *
 *          Er = cos(Tt) * (pi - Pt) - cos(T) * (pi - P);
 *          Et = sin(Tt) * (pi - Pt) - sin(T) * (pi - P);
 *
 *          (The behaviour in the > pi / 2 area is the symmetric of the behaviour in the <= pi / 2 zone;
 *
 *      After this calculation, two PIDs (PID_r, PID_t) are feed with appropriate error values.
 *
 *      The output vector (Or, Ot) is then determined. Both Or and Ot are outputs of their respective PIDs;
