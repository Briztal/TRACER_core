/*
 * This class is the virtual base for a control layer;
 *
 * A control layer represents a layer of control in your control scheme, and is defined by the following data :
 *
 *  - a child control layer, can be null;
 *  - a regulation action : given a target (float *), and a current position, it calls its child with computed data, or
 *      makes an action (sends a command to an actuator, sets data in RAM, etc...)
 *  - a set of modes. Target can be expressed in a system that is different of the one used to determine the action;
 *      The mode determines how target will be translated;
 *
 *
 *  As a programmer, your job is to implement the conversion translation function, the mode setting function, and
 *      the action function.
