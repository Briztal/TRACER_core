IMUKalmanFIlter : this class computes data from an Inertial Measurment Unit, composed of a 3D accelerometer,
and a 3D Gyrometer;
Each axis has its own kalman filter, as axis are supposedly independent.

Each filter follows the following model :
    '.' will be used to reference the axis we focus on, a  = x, y, or z;


    Measurements :

        M = (Sm., Am.),

        with :
            - Sm. = measured angular speed on axis "."(rad/s);
            - Am. = measured angular position on axis '.', (rad);


    States :

        X = (S., A., B.)

        with :
            - S = estimated angular speed (rad/s);
            - A = estimated angular position (rad);


    Prediction :

                | 1  0  0 |
        X+ =    | t  1  0 | * X
                | 0  0  1 |


    Measure model :

                | sr  0   sr |
        M  =    | 0   1   0  | * X + noise vector;

        with :
            - sr the conversion factor from sensor output to rad/s

        The conversion factor only exists for the gyro, as only gyro data is directly generated by the sensor;
        The orientation angle is computed from acceleration values, and so, doesn't need a conversion;
