/*
 * The Servo control module manages a variable number of servo channels, each channel communicating with one servo.
 *
 * 	The servo module has build-in parameters, that can be changed in the makefile :
 * 	- the timer to used, defined by its name; An invalid name will cause module to be unloaded;
 * 	- the period of all servos;
 * 	- the tolerance.
 *
 * 	All parameters that only concern one channel;
 *
 * 	Channels can be created, deleted, and their value can be set.
 *
 * 	All channels share the same period;
 *
 * Module lifecycle :
 *
 * 	- Initialisation :
 * 		The servo timer, the total period, and the minimal duration are provided;
 * 		No channel is added for instance, as the cycle period is not know;
 *
 *
 * 	- channels setup :
 * 		channels are created, adjusted, or deleted; The ISR becomes active if channels are active, and inactive if no
 * 		channel is active;
 *
 *
 *
 * Channels lifecycle :
 *
 * 	- Channels creation :
 * 		Channels are created with a name, a gpio and a maximal duration;
 * 		Their duration is set to 0, so that they only become active when required;
 *
 * 	- Channels duration setup;
 * 		A channel's duration can be adjusted at any time, while the channel exists; If the requires duration is beyond
 * 		its maximal value, it will be decreased to it; If
 *
 * 	- Channels deletion;
 * 		A channel can be deleted at any time, via the file system; The associated GPIO will be cleared;
