/*
 * The next lines focus on Interaction configuration. Interaction are static classes, meant only to interpret data.
 *
 * In order to receive orders from th outside, a Controller must receive_all its data from a Delimiter, that reads and process
 *  data over transmission layers;
 *
 * Delimiter are objects, created by the Kernel;
 *
 *  Transmission layers are static data defined in hardware_language_abstraction.
 *
 *  To create a log_protocol objetc, based on a transmission layer, and piped into a controller,
 *      you may add one line like below :
 *
 *  EXTERNAL_CONTROL(language, log_protocol, protocol_buffer_size, transmission_layer), where :
 *
 *      - language is the name of a Language class;
 *      - log_protocol is the name of a Delimiter class (Interaction/Delimiter);
 *      - protocol_buffer_size is the size of the Delimiter class's input buffer;
 *      - transmission layer is the name of a transmission layer (hardware_language_abstraction_xxxx.h)
