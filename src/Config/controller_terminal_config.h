/*
 * The following section defines the language of the parser.
 *
 *  This language is a tree, where every node is labeled by a word, and has a certain number of children.
 *
 *      For example, a simple language, supporting the three following commands :
 *          move home       (+args) -> call home_function
 *          move line of    (+args) -> call line_to_function
 *          move line to    (+args) -> call line_of_function
 *          halt            (+args) -> call halt_function
 *
 *      Will have its command tree like below :
 *
 *          move
 *             |- home ------> home_function
 *             |- line
 *             |    |- of ---> line_of_function
 *             |    |- to ---> line_to_function
 *          halt ------------> halt_function
 *
 *  The aim of this section is to define the structure of the tree.
 *
 *  To do this, you can use the 3 following commands :
 *
 *      - CREATE_LEAF(command, name)    : Create a leaf labelled "command", triggering the member function "name"
 *                              of the class TerminalCommands
 *      - GO_LOWER(command) :   following lines will define children of an new node labeled "command";
 *      - GO_UPPER() :          opposite of the previous command, terminate the section of the node defined by
 *                                  the last GO_LOWER
 *
 *
 *      For example, to build the tree in our previous example, we would write the following lines :
 *
 *      //Create a new node "move"
 *      GO_LOWER(move)
 *
 *      //Declare a command "move home" triggering home_function
 *      CREATE_LEAF(home, home_function)
 *
 *      //Create a new node "line"
 *      GO_LOWER(line)
 *
 *      //Declare a command "move line of" triggering line_of_function
 *      CREATE_LEAF(of, line_of_function)
 *
 *      //Declare a command "move line to" triggering line_to_function
 *      CREATE_LEAF(to, line_to_function)
 *
 *      //Finish the section of node "line"
 *      GO_UPPER()
 *
 *      //Finish the section of node "move"
 *      GO_UPPER()
 *
 *
 *      //Declare a command halt" triggering halt_to_function
 *      CREATE_LEAF(halt, halt_function)
 *
