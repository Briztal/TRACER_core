A word about power regulation in continuous actions.
2 modesare elements :
    - absolute power, M?//TODO
    - linear power, M?//TODO

When absolute mode is triggered for a specific action, the power will be maintained constant until you stop it, or until
linear mode is triggered.
When linear mode is triggered, the power delivered will be proportional to the global speed, according to the power ratio
you set. In linear mode, power will be enables as soon as motion starts
