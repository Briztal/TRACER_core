/**
 * A state is a memory representation. It contains variables that must be computed.
 *
 * 	It is composed of state variables and abstract variables.
 *
 * 	A state can have several states :
 * 	- empty : state and abstract variables are invalid;
 * 	- partial : state variables are valid, abstract are not;
 * 	- valid : both state and abstract are valid;
 *
 *
 * A controller is a set of determined values. They are provided to the solver.
 *
 * 	They intend to control the way the solver works;
 *
 *
 * Solving iteration :
 *
 * 	known data :
 * 		- current state, complete;
 *
 * 	data to determine :
 * 		- next state, complete;
 *
 * 	temporary data :
 * 		- current target state, partial;
 *
 *
 * 	process :
 * 		- use the solver to compute the current target state, using the current state;
 * 		- get the next state's state variables, using the current target state;
 * 		- complete the next state, using the current state;
 *
 *
 * The second step of the process composes the closed loop. It is when the state is updated, after the target state
 * has been used;
 * In physical systems, there is a delay between the time target state is computed, and next state is updated;
 * The algorithm should be then reformulated like below :
 *
 *
 * Solving iteration :
 *
 * 	known data :
 * 		- current state, complete;
 * 		- current target state, partial;
 *
 * 	data to determine :
 * 		- next state, complete;
 * 		- next target state, partial;
 *
 * 	process :
 * 		- get the next state's state variables, using the current target state;
 * 		- complete the next state, using the current state;
 * 		- use the solver to determine the next target state, using the next state;
 *
 * 	In this algorithm, current and next target have separate lifetimes. Both can occupy the same memory space.
 * 	current and next states, however, share a part of their lifetime, and must occupy different memory spaces.
