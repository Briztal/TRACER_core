/*
 * Core Structure :
 *
 * Main thread: Task manager. Runs basic tasks, like
 * - Communication Interface
 * - Basic interaction
 * - StepperControl Plannification for TRACER
 *
 * A task can be added, in the queue. Priorities may be defined in a future commit.
 *
 *
 * Level 0 Thread : Running permanent tasks, on non prioritary interrupts
 * - Control loops;
 * - Step process function

/*
 * The Machine Core.
 *
 * The Core is in charge of :
 * - setting up all used modules, in begin function;
 * - processing tasks, provided internally, or coming from any interface;
 *
 * Tasks are stored using 3 Queues :
 *
 *
 * (lower priority)
 *
 * priority 0 :
 *      - Permanent task queue : a list of background routines. Defined in the configuration file, unchangeable
 *              after compilation; these tasks have the lowest priority status.
 *
 * priority 1 :
 *      - External commands queue : a queue containing external commands, received by any interface;
 *
 * priority 2 :
 *      - Internal tasks queue : a queue containing tasks enqueued by an internal procedure.
 *              These tasks are processed with the highest priority.
 *
 * (higher priority)
