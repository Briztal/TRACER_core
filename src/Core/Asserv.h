/*
 * The Asserv class.
 *
 * It contains everything required to setup a control loop system.
 *
 * First, you can setup multiple PIDs, in the config file.
 *
 * These PIDs can be fed with any value you desire, but two categories are made for it in this class :
 *
 * - External parameters : parameters directly measured in your environment;
 *          (ex : pressure, temperature, vector sum of forces from an accelerometer)
 *
 * These Internal Parameters must be updated from External ones, and so, you must manually define updating functions
 *

    //------------------------------------------------External Parameters-----------------------------------------------

    /*
     * External parameters are represented by two values :
     *  - their setpoint, the value they are meant to reach;
     *  - their feedback, the value they currently have;
     *
     * As a consequence, two methods are defined :
     *  - set_[name]_setpoint : a public method, automatically implemented, callable from outside the class,
     *      that updates the setpoint to the desired value;
     *  - get_[name] : a private method, that you must implement for each parameter you define.
     *      It is in charge of collecting data required to determine the current feedback (maybe interrogate a sensor)
     *      and to actually determine and update the feedback.
