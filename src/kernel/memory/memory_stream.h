//---------------------------------------------------- stream ---------------------------------------------------

/*
 * The stream structure represents a directed memory zone of a determined type that is accessible for read/write.
 *
 *
 * 	The stream memory is a kernel file, and so, can only be created / deleted by the kernel;
 * 	The stream memory can be accessed directly via the kernel file system, or indirectly via a stream pipe. 
 *
 *
 * 	A stream pipe automatically (via interrupts of DMA) transfers data form an output stream to an input stream;
 *  A stream pipe is owned by either its input or output stream, and share the lifetime of its owner.
	When a pipe is opened between two streams, both corresponding files will be opened, and file descriptors will be
 * 	owned by the pipe;
 * 	No stream can be closed until its registered pipe is closed, and closes the stream file;
 *
 * 	When it is opened, the stream pipe is registered in the kernel file system, allowing to close the pipe;
 *
 * 	A stream can't be deleted until its registered pipe is closed; If the user attempts to delete a stream file, with
 * 	an opened pipe, the stream file will be unregistered from the file system, and will be marked orphan;
 *
 * 	As soon as the related pipe is closed, both stream files will be closed, and deleted, because marked orphans;
 * //TODO DO NOT CLOSE THE OTHER FILE, LET THE TRANSFER CLOSE IT, AS IT CAN CALL THE KERNEL;
