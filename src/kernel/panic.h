/*
 * The kernel manic library offers a log system for debug purposes, and a trigger for kernel panics.
 *
 * 	A kernel panic will halt any current code, put the kernel in safe mode, and display the log stack in the debug
 * 	interface;
 *
 * 	The log stack is static, and does not require any initialisation, so that it can be used in case of error, and
 * 	without dynamic memory;
