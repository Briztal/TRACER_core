/*
 * The Semaphore library.
 *
 *  It is used by the kernel to synchronise processes.
 *
 *  ----------------------- WARNING -----------------------
 *
 *  Semaphores synchronise processes. If they are not called from a process_t (in the ThreadManager's meaning), the
 *  The semaphore call will have no effect, as semaphores lock and unlock processes.
 *
 *  Semaphore can't (lol) lock interrupts;
 *
 *  A semaphore call from an interrupt will be detected, and ignored.
 *
 *  As a consequence, interrupts have full control on drivers, and can use them without any restrictions, but it
 *  can also cause damage, as it can shortcut potentially ordered procedures.
 *
 *  You must take that in consideration when writing your ISRs. Use it carefully;
