/*
 * The data hosts owns and grants access to data structures of a fixed (shared among them) size.
 *
 * 	All data is contained in the host. Each piece of data can be in one of the three following states :
 * 		- initialised : the data structure is filled and ready to be used; Data is not directly accessible;
 * 		- uninitialised : the data structure has already been used, and its data can't be used; Data is not
 * 			directly accessible;
 * 		- shared : the data's ownership is shared with one and only one caller.
 *
 * 	A function can request access from an uninitialised or initialised piece of data. When it gets access to it,
 * 	it passes in the shared state, and no one can access it;
 *
 * 	When the function has finished its job, it provides the data structure back, and tells the host its new state.
 * 	Data can be accessed again by another part of the code;
