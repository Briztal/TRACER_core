/*
 * The comput node is the most abstract and less specific data structure that can be manipulated during a
 * 	comput, and defines the standard function that can be used to interact with a comput node;
 *
 * 	A comput node stores arguments, and executes a comput, based on those arguments;
 *
 *  A function can be used to add some arguments in the storage, and another can be used to execute a
 * 	state in the comput that takes this data in arguments;
 *
 * 	This comput function returns a state, that can be :
 * 		- COMPLETE : the comput concerning a piece of data is over;
 * 		- PARTIAL : a stage in the comput of a piece of data is over;
 * 		- NO_EXECUTION : no stage was available;
 * 		- TERMINATED : the node has no data available;
