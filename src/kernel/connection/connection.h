/*
 * The connection library.
 *
 *  Connections are the base for safe data transmission across the code.
 *
 *  When the question of data transmission between a chain of independent nodes (software
 *  or hardware like peripherals) arises, several problems are encountered :
 *
 *  How to (thread)safely propagate information / spaces across the chain, when data can be provided on an interrupt
 *  , and so un-interruptable basis ?
 *
 *  How to ensure that data and spaces propagation functions are regularly executed ?
 *
 *  How to ensure that a certain amount of data provided by a transmitter can effectively be processed by its receiver
 *  (enough space in its internal buffer for example);
 *
 *  How to ensure that, if the connection is closed in one part of the chain (ex : serial close, or error), the
 *  entire the chain is effectively cleaned ?
 *
 *
 *  This library intends to provide a general solution to these issues, by formalising the data connection and its
 *  components; It does not replace data processing, but formalises the data exchange through a transmission chain.
 *  It is a simple formalisation, a direct implementation for a particular transmission chain is totally possible,
 *  but the amount of pitfalls in the correct implementation of a transmission chain made me prefer this abstraction;
 *
 *  A connection is composed of :
 *      - nodes in chain, responsible of processing and / or storing data;
 *      ex : a Serial, will receive and store data internally, a buffer will receive, process and transfer data;
 *      - flux, linking nodes, in charge of transferring data from one data processor to another;
 *      ex : the serial may provide its data to a buffer, the data flux unit will take this in charge;
 *
 *  Connections are created in threads, and can be processed from :
 *      - interrupts, ex : character received in the serial;
 *      - the connection service, a service in charge of processing / cleaning different connections;
 *
 *  A connection is established in a thread, and its ownership is passed to the connection service;
