/*
 * The Increment Computing class : this class computes the initial increment for a trajectory.
 *
 *  This step is absolutely necessary, as a position can only be enqueued in the sub_movement queue if the distance
 *      between this new position and the previous one is comprised in a certain interval.
 *
 *  This distance is determined by the index increment, the delta of the trajectory function's input variable.
 *
 *  This increment needs to be adjusted when a movement is planned. During the real-time position computation, it is
 *      again adjusted continuously, so that the distances between two consecutive positions continue to fit in the
 *      interval.
