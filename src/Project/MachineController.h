/*
 * The MachineController class is one of the two state-controllers of the project.
 *
 *  This class handles the mechanics state of the machine (movement, cooling, extrusion, position, ...).
 *      The Temperature control is handled by the named class.
 *
 *
 *  As this class can configure a lot of parameters, and trigger a lot of machine commands, it is built on
 *    the state manager model :
 *      - All its public functions (called state modifiers) take state structs in arguments.
 *      - A state struct is a structure where for all data field, there is a flag (bool) that defined if the
 *          data field's value is intentionnaly set.
 *      - When a state modifier is called, it reads all flags, and only proceeds data with their field set.
 *
 *  This model is useful, because it allows the programmer (you !!) to call a single function to modify several
 *      related parameters, for example, modify the speed of the working carriage and the speed
 *      of a particular carriage (named by its id);
 *
 *  The other solution would have been to create a single function for every single command executable, and a modifier
 *      for every single parameter, for example, we would have called a function to modify the speed of the working
 *      carriage's speed, and another to modify the speed of a carriage by its id).
 *
 *  This solution is viable too, but as functions are scheduled, and we often want to call two related actions at the
 *      same time (for example, set the current speed AND move to a position with that speed), we would have often
 *      called functions simultaneously, what would have occupied more nb_spaces in the scheduler.
 *
