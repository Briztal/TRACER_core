/*
 * This file contains the spec for the queue library;
 *
 *	The queue owns and grants access to memory blocks of a determined size. All blocks managed by the same queue
 *	have the same size;
 *
 * 	All blocks are owned by the queue. Each block can be either :
 * 	- initialised : the block contains valid data and ready to be used; block is inaccessible;
 *  - uninitialised : the block contains no valid data, and can be initialised; block is inaccessible;
 * 	- shared : the block is shared with an external program;
 *
 * 	A function can request access from an uninitialised or initialised piece of data. When it gets access to it,
 * 	it passes in the shared state, and no one can access it;
 *
 * 	When the function has finished its job, it provides the data structure back, and tells the queue its new state.
 * 	Data can be accessed again by another part of the code;
