/*
 * The LinearSystem class. This class intends to solve equations systems that can be represented like the following :
 *
 *
 *  (S) : A * X = B * Y
 *
 *  with :
 *      - X : a vector of variables, the outputs,  of size x_size;
 *      - Y : a vector that we would know, the inputs of the system, OF SIZE y_size < x_size !!!!!
 *      - A : an invertible square matrix of size x_size;
 *      - B : a rectangle matrix, of size x_size * y_size;
 *
 *
 *  The attentive reader will have notices that in difference to standard systems, there are less input variables than
 *      output variables. The B matrix's role is to re-equilibrate the degree of the system, in introducing a
 *      linear combination of Y's values, to provide B * Y, a vector of size x_size;
 *
 *  As the matrix A can be inverted, the solution system can be expressed like below :
 *
 *      (S =>) : X = Ai * B * Y
 *
 *      where Ai is the inverse of the matrix;
 *
 *  The aim of this class is to compute Ai * B, and eventually to provide an easy way to build A and B;
