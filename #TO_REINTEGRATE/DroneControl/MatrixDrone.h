 * MatrixDrone : this class is an abstract base for variable geometry drones models, with the condition that
 *  their behavior can be represented by a matrix system, when the geometry is fixed;
 *
 *  ie to a fixed geometry corresponds and unique Matrix system.
 *
 *  This system defines the model of the drone, ie the relation between the targets and command signals.
 *
 *  Targets can be of multiple types (forces, speeds), as can be command signals (speed, power targets);
 *
 *
 *  This class is a pure virtual model specification, that implements a set of functions for our abstract drone model;
