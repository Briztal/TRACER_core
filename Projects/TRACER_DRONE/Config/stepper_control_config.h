//---------------------------------------------------- Cartesian groups ------------------------------------------------

/*
 * In order to regulate speed, you must specify all cartesian groups of your machine.
 *
 *  A cartesian group is a group of at most 3 coordinates, in which the global speed, that will be regulated,
 *      can be defined as the norm of the speed vector, restricted to these coordinates.
 *
 *  WARNING : These coordinates are high level coordinates.
 *
 *  Stepper coordinates are images of high_level coordinates through the geometry_translate function.
 *
 *  They might have no physical meaning for stepper, but are used to control the machine.
 *
 *  Ex :
 *      A polar machine har a polar stepper coordinate system, but can be controlled with a cartesian
 *          high level coordinate system, as long as the translation from (x, y) to (theta, phi) is known,
 *          and implemented in geometry_translate.
 *
 *      In this example, there will be one cartesian group, containing x and y axis;
 */

#define NB_CARTESIAN_GROUPS 8


/*
 * To define a cartesian group, you may use the following command :
 *
 *  CARTESIAN_GROUP(id, s0, s1, s2, max_speed)
 *      - i : the index of the cartesian group. Indices start at 0, and are strictly consecutive;
 *      - s{0, 1, 2} : indices of steppers belonging to the group. If it contains less than 3 steppers,
 *          pad with one or two -1;
 *      - max_speed : the speed group's maximum speed;
