/*
 * The sched library defines a general structure to implement a sched;
 *
 * 	A sched is in charge of selecting which task must be executed, referencing processes, sorting them, and
 * 	updating their state (active - inactive) if required;
 *
 * 	The sched comprises at least two list :
 * 	- the task list, containing all referenced processes;
 * 	- the active task list, containing all active processes. This list is kept sorted by decreasing order of
 * 		priority. Thanks to this invariant, the first available task is always the most prioritary;
 *
 *
 * 	It is potentially used in two different interrupt levels :
 * 	- preemption, where the previous task's context is saved, and a new task is selected;
 * 		This interrupt level has the lowest priority, as preemption must not happen during any interrupt;
 * 	- system, where processes are created, and their states are modified.
 *
 *
 * 	In order to maintain data integer, several precautions must be taken :
 * 	- the preemption level only has access to select and get functions; The kernel only has access to other functions;
 * 	- only the preemption level can manipulate the couple of lists;
 * 	- stopping a task, or terminating it will simply set flags, procedures themselves being executed in function
 * 		select;
 * 	- adding or resuming a task will result in the push of the task in a shared fifo, (@to_add or @to_activate).
 * 		Those processes will still be inactive, until they are read and scheduled by the select function;
